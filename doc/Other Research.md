This maybe irrelevant to my research, I just found this by accident when I was doing my research, and I think this may be helpful for our project.

- Setup NVIDIA with Camera: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1705/1705.10945.pdf
  - This paper has an image showing how to connect camera to Jetson TX1
  
- How to build a robot: http://www.superdroidrobots.com/shop/custom.aspx/how-to-build-a-robot/70/
  - This link provides a list of choices for many elements on robot
  - It provides a list of remote controllers.
  - It also provides a list of motor controllers. Hope this can be an addition to Hannah's research.
  - I put it here for our future reference.
